Your task is to create a simple command handler whose job is to update an existing blog post, dispatch an event if the operation succeds and properly handle exceptions.

You don't have to worry about the rest of the application. Also all necessary classes will be imported out of the box, so you don't so you don't need to think about adding any "use" statements

Requirements

Your command handler must
1. Create a BlogPost object based on the data provided in the UpdatePost command
2. Update the post using the PostUpdater service provided in the handler constructor
3. Dispatch the PostUpdated event with a proper post ID using the EventDispatcher service, assuming no exceptions were thrown while performing the operations described in points 1 and 2 above.
4. Handle any exceptions that occur, depending on the exception class.

The following table shows how exceptions should be handled depending on their class
